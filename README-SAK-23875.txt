This branch is here in case people need to back port the trunk 
of the web content tool to Sakai 2.9.1.  Since it is possible that
a lot of schools may need to do this, I figure that we can share
testing and production experience.

If you will be running this in production - make sure to contact
me so we can make a tag so you are running a tag and not just this
branch in your production.
